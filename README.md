# C# Language Design

Welcome to the official repo for C# language design.

## Design Process

C# is designed by the C# Language Design Team (LDT).

***Design ideas*** should be posed and discussed on the [csharplang](https://lists.dot.net/mailman/listinfo/csharplang) mailing list. *They should not be opened as issues in this repo.* Ideas that the LDT feel could potentially make it into the language should be turned into proposals in this repo, either by members of the LDT or by community members by invitation from the LDT.

***Proposals*** live in the [proposals](proposals) folder. The lifetime of a proposal is described in [proposals/README.md](proposals/README.md).

***Language Design Meetings*** (LDMs) are held by the LDT and occasional invited guests, and are documented in Design Meeting Notes in the [meetings](meetings) folder, organized in folders by year. The lifetime of a design meeting note is described in [meetings/README.md](meetings/README.md). LDMs are where decisions about future C# versions are made, including which proposals do work on, how to evolve the proposals, and whether and when to adopt them.

## Language Specification

It is our plan to move the C# Language Specification into Markdown, and draft it in the `spec` folder. The spec drafts will eventually be standardized and published by ECMA.

## Implementation

The reference implementation of the C# language can be found in the [Roslyn repository](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn). Until recently, that was also where language design artifacts were tracked. Please allow a little time as we move over active proposals.
