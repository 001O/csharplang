# C# Language Design Notes for May 16, 2017

***Raw notes, yet to be cleaned up - read at your own peril***

# 7.1

## Pri pro almost there, push to 7.2

## #42 Field-targeted attributes
Community contributed? If so push to 7.2

# 7.2

"Slicing" needs to be split into "ref structs" and "slicing syntax"

Push out everything, except things that are "in theme", and things that are almost done (field-targeted, private protected)

Keep everything that's in theme until we can sit with the Span folks and prioritize.



# GitHub

Issues as a notification mechanism: start using that for design notes and proposals. Revisions are comments on the same issue.




# Triage of championed features

CallerArgumentExpression, push to 7.X and start process for attribute

0b_ 0x_

Native ints

Static delegates: They require, generally, 2 allocations, are crappy for interop. Static delegates are typed `IntPtr`s, essentially.
`ValueAction` and `ValueFunc`. Lot of asks from CoreRT, for PInvoke etc. 

## XML doc comments
This is hard to take as a community contribution: it's primarily about the IDE behavior. Not all of that may even be open source today.
It would also affect ecosystem, which would have to handle it. Need to coordinate with IDE team.

## `??` and `?.` for pointers
Probably lo-pri to make this pleasant. But nothing against it. This seems suitable for up-for-grabs

It should probably be `?->`. Double pointers, you're out of options.


## Non-trailing named arguments
Helps selectively put names, and therefore people don't bend over backwards to put name-prone parameters last. Also would make it work better with params.

Would need some ide work.
