# C# Language Design Notes for Mar 7, 2017

Quote of the Day: "Now `(T)default` means the same as `default(T)`!"

## Agenda

We continued to flesh out the designs for features currently considered for C# 7.1.

1. Default expressions
2. Field target on auto-properties
3. private protected


# Default expressions
[github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/102](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/102)

We plan to allow target typed `default` expressions, where the type is left off:

``` c#
int i = default(int); // Current
int i = default;      // New
var i = default;      // Error: no target type
```

In essence, `default` is like `null`: an inherently typeless expression, that can acquire a type through implicit or explicit conversion. Unlike `null`, `default` can be converted to *any* type `T`, including non-nullable value types, and is equivalent to `default(T)` for that `T`. For types where both `null` and `default` are allowed, they both have the same value, namely null.

## Constants

Like `null` and `default(T)`, `default` is a constant expression *for certain types*.

``` c#
const string S = null;    // sure
const string S = default; // sure
const int? NI = null;     // error
const int? NI = default;  // error
```

This is just a consequence of the existing limitations on which types can be constants.

## Constant patterns

Constant patterns are interpreted in context of the type of the expression they are tested against. For instance, if the left hand side of an `is` expression is of an enum type `E`, `0` is the zero value of that enum type, not the int zero:

``` c#
E myE = ...;

if (e is 0) ... // 0 means (E)0, not (int)0;
```

For `null`, this means that the null value created by the constant pattern is of the reference or nullable value type of the left hand side. A `null` pattern is not allowed if the type of the left hand side is a non-nullable value type, or a type parameter not known to be a reference type. 

As a special dispensation, however, `null` *is* allowed as a constant pattern even if the type of the left hand side is not one that allows constants.



Also, `default` cannot be used as a constant pattern:

``` c#
if (i is default) ... // error
```

On the other hand, expressions of the form `default(T)` are explicitly allowed as default arguments of optional parameters, and therefore, so is `default`:

``` c#
void M(MyStruct ms = default) { ... } // sure
```

## Special forms

## Syntax
 

We allow `null == null`, should we allow `default == default`?

`as` and `is`: work for null.

Question: When should I use default, when should I use null? Style wars?

Can't use `null` as the syntax for this, as it would allow `null` to convert to `int`, which would be breaking.

We could also disallow `default`, when the type is known to be a reference type.

Let's not restrict it in the language. It would be a matter of style, and the IDE might give you options about it. The default would probably be `null` when we can, `default` otherwise, and `default(T)` when we have to.

"Now `case default:` is allowed!" :-) warning?

Resolution on not-typed syntax that works for null: don't. No `throw default`, no `default == default`, etc. 

`default as long` still disallowed, because the rhs can't be a non-nullable value type.
`default as string` allowed

`x is default` is not allowed when `x is default(T)` would have been allowed, where `T` is the type of `x`. That's because we check whether the rhs is a constant, *before* its conversion.

`default is T` should not be allowed. It would not mean the same as `default(T) is T`, but more like `default(object) is T`, which is always false.

"Now `(T)default` means the same as `default(T)`!"





# Field target

We like this, the design is great, we are good with the drawbacks. If the break turns out to be significant (it won't), we can loosen the specific case.


# private protected

Let's really assure ourselves that this works in the runtime!

What will F# do? They need to understand the metadata even if they can't "see" the members

Lots of tools might get confused. CCI? 

It was in C++/CLI but that may not have exercised enough.

Needs to go into C# and VB.

Fair amount in the IDE - test intellisense works out, refactorings etc. Keyword recommendations, etc.
