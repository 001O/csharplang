# C# Language Design Notes for Mar 7, 2017

***Raw notes, yet to be cleaned up - read at your own peril***



# Default

We allow `null == null`, should we allow `default == default`?

`as` and `is`: work for null.

Question: When should I use default, when should I use null? Style wars?

Can't use `null` as the syntax for this, as it would allow `null` to convert to `int`, which would be breaking.

We could also disallow `default`, when the type is known to be a reference type.

Let's not restrict it in the language. It would be a matter of style, and the IDE might give you options about it. The default would probably be `null` when we can, `default` otherwise, and `default(T)` when we have to.

"Now `case default:` is allowed!" :-) warning?

Resolution on not-typed syntax that works for null: don't. No `throw default`, no `default == default`, etc. 

`default as long` still disallowed, because the rhs can't be a non-nullable value type.
`default as string` allowed

`x is default` is not allowed when `x is default(T)` would have been allowed, where `T` is the type of `x`. That's because we check whether the rhs is a constant, *before* its conversion.

`default is T` should not be allowed. It would not mean the same as `default(T) is T`, but more like `default(object) is T`, which is always false.

"Now `(T)default` means the same as `default(T)` :-)"





# Field target

We like this, the design is great, we are good with the drawbacks. If the break turns out to be significant (it won't), we can loosen the specific case.


# private protected

Let's really assure ourselves that this works in the runtime!

What will F# do? They need to understand the metadata even if they can't "see" the members

Lots of tools might get confused. CCI? 

It was in C++/CLI but that may not have exercised enough.

Needs to go into C# and VB.

Fair amount in the IDE - test intellisense works out, refactorings etc. Keyword recommendations, etc.
