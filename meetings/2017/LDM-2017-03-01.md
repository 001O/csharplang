# C# Language Design Notes for Mar 1, 2017

***Raw notes, yet to be cleaned up - read at your own peril***



A static approach, where you imbue things with properties *statically*, but they are not part of the objects at runtime.

Protocols would be real types, you can have a list of them.

Impl with specialization: size in memory isn't too much of a concern, but startup cost is, and specializations hurt that. NGEN can help with that, but not all platforms are equal here. You can hope that this is mostly in foundational layers.

The proposal is assuming no changes to the runtime, but you could make the runtime do better and understand more, even in compatible ways. Worth exploring.

Extension of shapes: Can be done just with a constraint on a type parameter?

Observation: for the case where a type naturally satisfies a shape, the conflation of extension and witness isn't helpful. Also, for the scenario of parameterizing an algorithm that wants to maybe use different names for them.

The disambiguation doesn't work if you want to specify more than one extension, because there's more than one shape constraint on a given type parameter.

Make sure that we think about there being more than one type parameter on shapes.

There may be an impedence mismatch with runtime/reflection based things: dependency injection etc. The structure of the projection matters to consumers (also serialization). What do other languages do?

Protocols and type classes may be mutually exclusive - or there's a middle ground. 


# ref ternary

``` c#
ref x = ref m;

// original proposal
cond ? ref v1 : ref v2

// alternative proposal
cond ? v1 : v2 // just figure out if it's variable or not
(cond ? v1 : v2).M(await ...); // problem: can't spill
(cond ? v1 : v2).M(...);       // problem: breaking change, mutating original variable

var x = ++(cond ? v1 : v2);
(cond ? v1 : v2) = 42;
(cond ? ref v1 : ref v2) = 42;
```

The fact that we have an alternative, makes it less attractive to consider breaking changes.

The await example shows that something is broken with the approach. What would the error message be when the compiler fails?
