# C# Language Design Notes for Feb 22, 2017

***Raw notes, yet to be cleaned up - read at your own peril***



## Agenda

We went over the proposal for `ref readonly`: [Champion "Readonly ref"](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/38).

# readonly refs

Passing and returning by ref addresses the copying and out parameter nightmare of performance critical code over structs. However, the use of it comes with risk: the recipient of a passed or returned ref can freely modify it.

This proposal introduces a `readonly` modifier on ref parameters and returns that incurs restrictions on the recipient of the ref similar to those incurred by a `readonly` modifier on a field. Thus, a ref can safely be passed or returned without risk of the recipient mutating it. This eliminates one common source of (deliberate, defensive) struct copying in C# code.

## Conclusion
We want to support this.

# readonly struct types

In and of itself, though, readonly refs contribute to another source of struct copying: when a method or property is invoked on a `readonly` struct (including now a readonly ref parameter or local), the C# compiler *implicitly* copies the struct, as a defense against the method or property invocation mutating the original struct. In the common case where the member is not actually mutating the struct, this is pure waste.

To counter this, the proposal also allows the `readonly` modifier on struct type declarations themselves. This signifies that no function member is mutating, and therefore calling them does not need to incur a copy. Inside struct members, `this` would be a readonly ref instead of a ref.

Once we have this feature, we could start warning on the compiler's defensive copying (with a warning wave for back compat).

More detailed versions are possible, where readonly-ness can be per struct member. This may not be necessary in practice, based on experience from the Midori project. (Or we can make it not strictly enforced, or allow exceptions that are somehow marked.)

## Conclusion
Support readonly struct types for now, until and unless evidence shows the need for per-member decisions.

# Syntax

We've been calling this feature "readonly ref", but it is really not the ref that is readonly; rather it is the thing that is referenced. For that reason is more correct to call it `ref readonly`, as in:

``` c#
public ref readonly Choose(ref readonly int i1, ref readonly int i2) { ... }
```

Currently, refs *themselves* are always single-assignment in C#, but if we decide at some point to make them reassignable by default (which we could do without breaking), then you might want to be able to *explicitly* put a `readonly` modifier on the refs themselves. That would be `readonly ref`. And of course you could have `readonly ref readonly` where both the ref and the target are readonly.

## `in` parameters

`ref readonly` is a bit of a mouthful. For parameters, `ref readonly` is in fact the exact opposite of `out`: something that comes in but cannot be modified. It would make total sense to call them `in` parameters. However, it would probably be confusing to call a *return* value `in`, so `in` should be allowed as a shorthand for `ref readonly` exclusively on parameters.

## Call site annotations

With today's refs you need a call site `ref` annotation. This is to warn the caller of potential side effects and make sure they buy into them. Do we need it for `ref readonly` parameters, where there are no side effects by definition? 

## Explicit or implicit

Are fields in readonly structs automatically readonly?


# Extension methods

We want extension methods on structs to be able to work by ref, so they don't copy. We should allow ref and ref readonly extension methods on value types.

Ref extension methods on classes could be controversial - like an `EnsureNotNull` method that replaces the object reference in the variable. We are not necessarily opposed to this in principle, but we don't need it for this scenario, and we'd have to track down weird consequences of it.

## Readonly parameters and locals

Not required for the scenario, but seems to be part of the same package, and is a long standing request.

## Readonly ref or ref readonly

The thing that's readonly is the thing being ref'ed, not the ref itself. The work `readonly` should probably come after the `ref`, right before the type.

Later we may make refs reassignable. At that point we'd want to allow an optional readonly *in front of* ref.


# Versioning

What happens when older code references newer code with ref readonly return. Upgrade the compiler, and you're broken. Can we encode it in metadata in such a way that it breaks downlevel? modreqs? Possibly, but then putting it on existing libraries is a library breaking change.

The CLR already doesn't protect this feature. 

It's very similar to nullability. We need a general philosophy for how we add these features.

You can't avoid bad actors (reflection etc), but we want to avoid accidentally breaking guarantees, and also breaking code.

1. ref readonly parameter on a non-virtual method
2. ref readonly parameter on a virtual method
3. ref readonly return

2 and 3 create a loophole - those are the ones we would crack down on with modreqs if we want to prevent accidental non-readonly ref calling from older versions of C#.


# Callsite annotations? Values?

``` c#
void M(ref readonly S s) { ... }

S s = ...;
M(ref readonly s); // 1
M(ref s);          // 2
M(s);              // 3

M(DateTime.Now);       // 4
M(SReturningMethod()); // 5
```

It seems that we'd want 3 as the best syntax, since the user doesn't have side effects to opt into.

If we allow 4 and 5, it would introduce a copy. This may be worrisome (perf not obvious).

Nevertheless, let's as a strawman allow all of 3, 4, and 5. This also makes it possible to do efficient operators, e.g. on matrices and vectors

Should we allowed conversions even when a variable is passed in (which would then be copied)? In the strawman: yes.

Kestrel will give us good feedback.

# Syntax decisions:

- `ref readonly` annotations everywhere, `in` as a shorthand in parameter position
- `return ref v` for returns
- callsites no annotation
