# C# Language Design Notes for Feb 28, 2017

***Raw notes, yet to be cleaned up - read at your own peril***




"I don't have time to dislike your proposal, but I do!"

## Agenda

Ensure design for candidate C# 7.1 features

# ref ternary

``` c#
ref int x = ref If(arr1 != null, ref arr[0], ref arr2[0]); // Wrong!
ref int x = ref (arr1 != null ? ref arr[0] : ref arr2[0]);   // Right!
(arr1 != null ? ref arr[0] : ref arr2[0]) = 5;
```

Alternative proposal: If the two branches are already variables of the same type, then the result of a ternary is also a variable, and can be ref'ed.

``` c#
ref int x = ref arr1 != null ? arr1[0] : arr2[0]; // shorter, but ref confusing
ref int x = ref (arr1 != null ? arr1[0] : arr2[0]); // different precedence?
(arr1 != null ? arr1[0] : arr2[1]) = 5; // sure
```

Readonly needs to be tracked.

Order of evaluation: Spec says take location, then evaluate rhs and assign. Compiler evaluates rhs first.

``` c#
a[i] = e; // e happens first
(c ? a[i] : a[i]) = e; // ternary would happen first
```

Probably not a problem in practice.

Field like events: should this work for that? Could probably work.

## Conclusion
- Yes to doing it
- Syntax: no refs inside (recursively)
- Precedence not an issue - `ref` is not part of the expression
- Field like events: sure, if it makes sense

Problem:

``` c#
(b ? v1 : v2).M(); 
```

If v1 and v2 are value type variables, this will now mutate original instead of copy. Good breaking change? Stopgap?

An approach is to define variable-ness of ternaries not from the inside out, but by "reinterpreting" it whenever it occurs in variable contexts not allowed today (ref, assignment).

``` c#
(ref b ? v1 : v2).M(); 
```

This

# async Main

``` c#
static async void Main()
{
    await TestAsync(3);
    await TestAsync(5);
    await Task.WhenAll(TestAsync(3), TestAsync(5));
} 
```

This is not like async void, because it does not return immediately.

Instead we should make it return `Task`


``` c#
    static async Task __MainAsync()
    {
        await TestAsync(3);
        await TestAsync(5);
        await Task.WhenAll(TestAsync(3), TestAsync(5));
    }

static async void Main() => await __MainAsync();
[EntryPoint] static void __Main() => __MainAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult();
```

Anyone who calls the `Main` method will get proper async void behavior, but the entry point version waits for completion. 

Allow `MainAsync` as a name?
Allow `async Task Main()`? Yes!
Allow `Task Main()`? Yes


SHould we *dis*allow `async void Main`, on the grounds that async void is bad, and make it about `Task Main` (`async` optional). If we get a ton of complaints, we can add it later. We'll disallow `async void Main` as an entry point to start with, knowing that it may yield some feedback.

Allow `Task<int>`? Yes.
Allow other tasklikes? No. Not for now. Very little value. Just await your tasklike in an `async Task Main`.






# "default" expression

# Field-targeted attributes on auto-properties

# Better "common type" algorithm

# private protected

# discards for lambda parameters

# Mix declarations and variables in deconstruction

# permit match of expr of type T:base with derived

# allow expression variables in field and constructor initializers
