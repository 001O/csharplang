# C# Language Design Meetings

C# Language Design Meetings (LDM for short) are meetings by the C# Language Design Team and invited guests to investigate, design and ultimately decide on features to enter the C# language. It is a creative meeting, where active design work happens, not just a decision body. 

Every C# language design meeting is represented by a meeting notes file in this folder.

## Purpose of meetings notes

Meeting notes serve the dual purposes of

- recording decisions so they can be acted upon
- recording rationale so we can return later and see why we did things the way we did

The latter has proved surprisingly useful over time!

## Life cycle of meeting notes

- If upcoming design meetings have a specific agenda, there may be a meeting notes file with that agenda even before the meeting happens
- After the meeting notes will be saved directly here. 
- Usually they will be raw notes in need of subsequent cleaning up. If that's the case, they will be clearly marked as such, and a work item will track the task of cleaning up the notes.
- When the notes are finalized, a notification is sent to the mailing list. Discussion can happen there.
- If the notes impact current proposals, work items will track updating those proposals.
- When updated, the proposals link back to the meeting where the proposal was discussed.
