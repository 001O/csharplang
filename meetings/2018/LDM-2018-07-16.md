# C# Language Design Notes for Jul 16, 2018

## Agenda (planned)

Null-related features

1. Null-coalescing assignment (`??=`) https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/34
    * Also in this proposal are `||=` and `&&=`, but it’s not clear if they’re actually championed.
2. Null-conditional await (`await?`) https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/35
    * As part of this, I think we should also consider other constructs that could benefit. On my list here are yield and foreach.
3. Null operator support for pointer types https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/418
    * Array dereferences (`p?[a]`), pointer dereferences (`p?->a`), and null coalescing operators (`p ?? q`) are on the list here.
