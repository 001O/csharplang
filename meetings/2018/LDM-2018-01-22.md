# C# Language Design Notes for Jan 22, 2018

***Warning: These are raw notes, and still need to be cleaned up. Read at your own peril!***

# Range

``` c#
var numbers = ints[from..to];
```

Should this mean inclusive?

Not many languages have *only* inclusive ranges. Apart from F#, they tend to either have exclusive ranges or both (at the upper end; the lower is always inclusive).

Python has exclusive, though a lot of people seem to be confused about it.
```
var s = a[0..a.Length];
```

Do we read it out loud as "zero *to* a dot length"? If so, then the intuition really does suggest inclusive.

```
foreach (var x in 1..100) { ... }

foreach (var x in 0..100) { ... }
```

You don't use constants in practice, though, except as a zero lower bound. In F# it is often a bit of a pain for do a for loop for array iteration, for instance. 

Exclusive is "in the middle" between inclusive and start/length. 

``` c#
// The three scenarios with exclusive
Range incl = start..end+1;
Range excl = start..end;
Range rel  = start..start+length;
Range emp  = 0..0;

// The three scenarios with inclusive
Range incl = start..end;
Range excl = start..end-1;
Range rel  = start..start+length-1;
Range emp  = 0..-1;

// The three scenarios with start/length
Range incl = start:end-start+1;
Range excl = start:end-start;
Range rel  = start:length;
Range emp  = 0:0;
```

From the TensorFlow (504), NUmPy (1,063) - both numeric heavy- and Python’s core libraries (2,094).  Only one use of “end-range plus one”, ie, used in exlusive way

More data for you: in F#’ compiler source code, out of 1,034 uses of ranges, 51 use the idiom limit-1

Fixed: 64 out of 1,034

Go source code, out of 5865, 11 need “+1” 
 
One idea is that when we start talking about sets of numbers (not enumerations) we should just have a different syntax. That's in pattern matching/containment checking, etc.

``` c#
x is in 3 to 5;
x is in 3--5;
x is in 3 !.. 5
```

Tensors are really just multidimensional arrays, so similar arguments apply.


Let us go with `..` means exclusive.


## Open ended

Is represented as such in the type. Syntax:

``` c#
Range openL = ..5;
Range openR = 3..;
Range openLR = ..;
```

``` c#
r1 = ..12;
r2 = 3..;

var a = new int[5];
a[r2]; // fine
a[r1 * r2]; // fail;
Range x = new Range(r1.Start, r2.End);
Range x = r1.EndAt(r2);
```

Would like not to write conditional logic to manipulate and combine ranges.

## Natural type

``` c#
var r = 4..6; // infer Range
```

If we do this, `Range` will be forever tied to it as the preferential type.

We're good with that.


## Start/length

Can technically be added later, but if we want to do it we should try to do it now.
