# Ref reassignment

https://github.com/agocke/roslyn/blob/4de95445af874269e74f9b022d83c89d85ec9669/docs/features/ref-reassignment.md

What do we gain by making it an expression form? Might be hard to understand. Should we have it only as a statement form?

``` c#
M(ref (x = ref b ? ref v1 : ref v2)); // or
M(ref x = ref b ? ref v1 : ref v2);

// as opposed to

x = ref b ? ref v1 : ref v2;
M(ref x)

// Linked list walking
while ((x = ref x.Next) != null)
{

}
```

Against: might be confusing.
For: regularity. People are already aware that assignment-as-an-expression shouldn't be overused.

There should be a principle that expressions never start with `ref`. Therefore, `ref` in an expression is always part of an enclosing construct. This principle will help people (a little) reasoning about these expressions.

Linked list walk is convincing. Make them expressions.

``` c#
void M(in object o)

string s = ...;

M(in s); // allowed? covariance? No. Invariant, like out and ref.
```

Lifetime of RHS must be at least as long as lifetime of LHS.

What's the lifetime of an uninitialized ref local? Discuss later.

Foreach and for variables allow ref in syntax. In the `for` loop, this needs reassignment. 

Foreach iteration variables can never be reassigned in the body, and that is also the case for ref iteration variables: they cannot be ref reassigned.


# Constraints

``` c#
void M<T1, T2, T3>()
    where T1: unmanaged
    where T2: Enum
    where T3: Delegate
    {
        
    }
```

## Unmanaged

It should be called `unmanaged`, not some other word like `blittable`. F#, the runtime and the C# spec all use the term "unmanaged".

It can't be a keyword (would be breaking) and not even a contextual keyword (in the sense that there's a syntactic context that determines it). Instead it needs to be semantically recognized.

Just like var, it can be escaped to make clear that you are using it as an identifier. If it is in scope, there's no way to get at the constraint meaning of it.


## Delegate

It is useful to allow Delegate as a constraint, as it has several methods on it. It doesn't guarantee that the type argument would be a delegate type; it could be `Delegate` itself, or `MulticastDelegate`, etc. 

Let's just unblock `System.Delegate` and `MulticastDelegate` from being a constraint, and give it no special meaning. This is useful and *reduces* complexity in the language. (Let's assume the same for VB as well).

## Enums

Same for enum. Let's not make a special feature for `Enum + struct`, but just stop disallowing `Enum`.

``` c#
where T : struct, System.Enum
```

We need a special rule to allow them together, since otherwise only interfaces are allowed to combine with the `struct` constraint.

## Arrays

`System.Array` is then the only non-sealed reference type that is prevented from being a constraint. Ideally we should remove this restriction as well, but we don't have a scenario, haven't been asked for it, and don't want to bother making sure it'll be alright.

Also System.ValueType


# Stackalloc initializers

``` c#
var x = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }; // allowed today
var z = stackalloc int[5];  // z is int*;
Span<int> zs = stackalloc int[5];  // target typed
var y = stackalloc int[] { 1, 2, 3 }; // should be allowed? y is int*
Span<int> ys = stackalloc int[] { 1, 2, 3 }; // should be allowed? y is Span<int>
```

The `int*` is for back compat. In contexts other than this the natural type is `Span<T>`.

There would be other ways to skin the cat, but would probably add more syntax and not reduce the inconsistency - just push it around.

Should we allow the type to be inferred from the initializer, just as with array initializers? Yes.


# Deconstruct

``` c#
public static void Deconstruct(this int i, out int x, out int y);
public static void Deconstruct(this in int i, out int x, out int y);
public static void Deconstruct(this ref int i, out int x, out int y);
```

Currently 1 and 2 are allowed as deconstructors, 3 is not. 

While 3 is probably not desirable, you could argue that it is an arbitrary limitation, that is strangely specific.

You will only be able to deconstruct lvalues! So be it.


# Native ints

Won't make 7.3


# Discard ambiguity
