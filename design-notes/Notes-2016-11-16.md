Nullable types
==============

MVP Feedback - a bit of a dissonance between calling it "types" and not having guarantees. Talk about it more like analyzers.

General annotations? Do we want to keep doing this specifically per feature or have a general framework for it? Maybe. Let's keep that in the back of our minds. We don't want to be blocked by figuring that out right now.

It's not the intention that knowing something is not-null influences overload resolution.

Issue: We need to decide whether to track x.y when both are reference types, and to what extent we will track aliasing. Guarantees vs usefulness.

Issue: The dammit operator: should it generate a runtime check. There are pros and cons.

Issue: Is the nested check really useful? On arrays you almost always have null elements.

Issue: Casts are assertions, but will not be able to check the nullness of type arguments.

Issue: "!" on type parameters that may be nullable?

The distinction between nullable and non-null warnings is not useful, and some of them (conversions) kind of belong to both.

Issue: We need to think about where types need to be the same for declarative reasons (overrides, etc)

It's similar to tuples in that we have runtime types ornated with extra compile time information. That's a good analogy for a check list, but we should feel free to reach different conclusions.

"null literal" => "null constant"

constructor check needs to also look through value types for nested non-null reference types.

Issue: constructor check could be before calling helpers or only at the end.

Issue: the array hole: should we disallow/discourage arrays of non-null?

Issue: What should people do to go from `T?[]` to `T[]`? Can `!` be applied for the recursive case? Otherwise, casts may be necessary.

Issue: `default(T)` is of type `T` or `T?`? you could shut it up with `!`.

Issue: Should it be evident from an assembly whether unannotated means non-null or not? Could be acceptable to paint with a broad brush. The "don't care" third type would have to be embraced.

Issue: unconstrained type parameters: need to ensure that T is assignable to T, and T to U when T is constrained by U. It's more complicated than just saying warn from both sides.

Issue: Is this set of warnings part of the language, or are they a "compiler feature" - essentially some built-in analyzers. In the latter case they might evolve in a breaking way.

For generics we should find a few samples that we believe are representative, and focus on them. May reuse ones from Midori.

Note: Fine that you can get nullable reference types implicitly (e.g. inference from string, null).

Issue: What are the semantics around shut-up types, and sources of them.

Note: not annotating locals would reduce the number of places that would need to be fixed. It's a trade-off between expressiveness and upgrade burden. This goes to granularity of opt-in as well. Readability disconnect between locals and fields.

Issue: should `var?` be allowed, should `var` always be nullable? How to express intent here.

Note: For the proposal `T! x` may be better as `T x!`, since it's about the parameter itself, and would actually name the parameter in the exception thrown!

TryGet: Could get away with non-language flourishes, such as attributes. "DefinitelyAssignedWhenTrue".

Issue: Doing the flow analysis thing for nullable value types is more concerning, because it's adding new runtime semantics.

Issue: flow on value types may work for dereferencing, but not so well if it is an argument: what if there are many?

Flow is a nice-to-have add-on.
